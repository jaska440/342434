So I just wait by the door, don't know what I'm headin' for
And if it's me and the beat, I'm keepin' one on the floor
You're like a landline always keep my hands tied
Wonder how I like you and lie to you at the same damn time
What's up? Uh, steady on repeat
I was numb, give me third degree burns, baby
I'm only window shopping
No room in my closet
I wanna be the only one you need
I wanna be the only one you need
I wanna be the only one you need
I wanna be the only one, only one
Only one you need
I wanna be the only one you need
I wanna be the only one you need
I wanna be the only one, only one
Ten, nine, everybody gimme, gimme more
FaceTime, crazy 'cause my face is always bored
What's your take? Never have enough space
Wasted a lot of time on you and I'm gonna waste some more, okay
Fight for it, baby, I'm alone
More and more surprised that I'm more and more at home
Stop playin' around, look at me now
I'm tastin' a little bit of everythin'
